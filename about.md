My interest begins with the environment as a whole and understanding the correlation between the inhabitants of an ecosystem amongst the other things within it. That said, we often find ourselves in a sort of ecosystem wherever we may go. With the understanding of our dynamic world and environments, our world is ever so changing, and the technologies we add to it impact us and the surroundings we inhabit in adverse ways. From understanding the intricacies of ecosystems and what factors go into shaping our world, the understanding of behaviors gives insights to the shaping of a system and the technologies chosen to be utilized within it. I am enthralled by the distinct correlation of maintaining environments through the use of tech, statistics, and data, which is where the informatics plays as an addition to my major as we live in a data-driven society.

Data is all around us... we give it, we use it, we are it... in a sense and without it the world wouldn't be what it is today and what it will be tomorrow. Data Science is what I strive toward given my background and understanding of the environment and world we live in, given that it is through data science, statistics, and simple ecology that give way to why and how our societies function as they do. I have the aspiration and inclination to continue to further my knowledge about Data Science, Statistics, GIS, Python, R, and other useful tools to aid in my development as a savant of this mercurial field.
